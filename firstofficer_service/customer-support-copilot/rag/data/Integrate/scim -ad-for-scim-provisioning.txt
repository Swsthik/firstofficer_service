# Enable  Azure AD for SCIM provisioning

You can automate the process of provisioning and deprovisioning your Azure Active Directory (AD) users and groups in Atlan withSystem for Cross-domain Identity Management(SCIM).
To enable Azure AD for SCIM provisioning, complete the following steps.
For any questions about SCIM provisioning, head overhere.


# Prerequisitesâ

- Azure AD SSO must be enabled for Atlan.
- Azure AD users or groups must be assigned to Atlan.
- Group mapping must be configured, only required if syncing mapped groups from Azure AD to Atlan. For any new groups created in Azure AD, you will first need tocreate corresponding groups in Atlanand thenmap the groupsto sync them through SCIM provisioning.


# Retrieve SCIM token in Atlanâ

You will need yourAtlan adminto complete these steps   -  you may not have access yourself. You will also need inputs and approval from your Azure AD administrator.
Â You will need to generate a SCIM token in Atlan forauthentication in Azure AD.

# Provision users and groupsâ

You will need toassign users or groups to Atlanfrom Azure AD before you can provision them. You will also need toconfigure group mappingÂ to sync mapped groups from Azure AD to Atlan. For any new groups created in Azure AD, you will first need tomap the groupsin Atlan to sync them through SCIM provisioning.
After you haveenabled SCIM provisioningandassigned users and groups to Atlanin Azure AD, you can provision them to Atlan. In Azure AD, users and groups can be provisioned in two ways   -provisioning cycleandon-demand provisioning.
Note the following:
- The username and email address of new and existing users cannot be changed once users have been provisioned to Atlan.
- If provisioning any users that already exist in Atlan, ensure that their Azure AD credentials match the existing credentials in Atlan for provisioning to be successful.
To provision users and groups, within Azure AD:
- Log in to yourAzure portaland search for and selectAzure Active Directory.
- From the left menu underManage, selectEnterprise applications.
- From theAll applicationspage, select theSAML applicationyou created to configure SSO in Atlan.
- In the left menu of your application page,Â underManage, clickProvisioningand select a provisioning method:To enableprovisioning cycle, in the upper left of theOverviewpage, clickStart provisioningand toggle theProvisioning StatustoOn.To enableon-demand provisioning, from the left menu, clickProvision on demand. To provision users or groups on demand:ForSelect a user or group, search for and select a user or group.At the bottom of the screen, clickProvision. Repeat the steps for every user or group you want to provision.
- To enableprovisioning cycle, in the upper left of theOverviewpage, clickStart provisioningand toggle theProvisioning StatustoOn.
- To enableon-demand provisioning, from the left menu, clickProvision on demand. To provision users or groups on demand:ForSelect a user or group, search for and select a user or group.At the bottom of the screen, clickProvision. Repeat the steps for every user or group you want to provision.
- ForSelect a user or group, search for and select a user or group.
- At the bottom of the screen, clickProvision. Repeat the steps for every user or group you want to provision.
Once you have enabled SCIM provisioning, Azure AD will automatically provision and update user accounts in Atlan. However, thesync typically happens every 40 minutes. So, it may take up to 40 minutes for user provisioning to be completed in Atlan.
There areknown limitationsto on-demand provisioning in Azure AD.

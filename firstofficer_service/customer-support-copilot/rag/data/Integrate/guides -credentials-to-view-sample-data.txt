- Authenticate SSO credentials to view sample data


# Authenticate SSO credentials to view sample data

AnyAtlan userwithdata access to the assetand SSO credentials for the connection. Atlan will display a100-row sample of the data.
Once your connection admins have configured SSO authentication, you can view sample data using your SSO credentials. Atlan currently supports the following connectors for SSO authentication:
- Amazon Redshift-  currently only Okta is supported as the identity provider.
- Google BigQuery-  Atlan uses Google OAuth 2.0, which handles integration with all identity providers. However, Atlan has only validated the integration with Okta.
- Snowflake-  Atlan usesSnowflake External OAuthfor SSO authentication, thus supporting allSnowflake-supported identity providers.
To view sample data using shared credentials instead, refer toProvide credentials to view sample data.

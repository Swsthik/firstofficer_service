# What type of user provisioning does Atlan support for SSO integrations?

Atlan currently supportsSystem for Cross-domain Identity Management(SCIM) capabilities for user provisioning for:
- Azure AD
- Okta
Atlan also supportsjust-in-time(JIT) user provisioning and automated assignment of user groups during every login for severalSSO providers. Once a user is deprovisioned in your SSO provider, the user will not be able to log into Atlan. Since the user profile in Atlan is not deleted automatically, you will also need todisable the user.

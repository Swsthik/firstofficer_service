- Tag propagation


# Tag propagation

Tag propagation is disabled by default in Atlan.
Whentagging an asset, you can enable tag propagation tochildassets.


# To downstream assetsâ

Downstream assets are derived through thedata transformationsof an asset.
Atlan can propagate tags through lineage. For example:
- Youtag a columnasPII.
- That column has downstream columns (in lineage).
- Atlan tags the downstream columns asPII, too, if propagation is enabled.
This is particularly useful when you want to tag data for protection reasons. When combined withpurposes, Atlan protects all downstream copies of the data automatically.


# To child assetsâ

Child assets are linked to parent assets through a parent-child hierarchical relationship.
Atlan can propagate tags from parent to child assets. For example:
- Youtag a database tableasMarketing Analysis.
- Atlan tags all the columns in that table asMarketing Analysis, too, if propagation is enabled.
- You can also configure the propagation of your tags:Hierarchy & lineageenables tag propagation to child and downstream assets.Hierarchy only (no lineage)enables tag propagation to child assets only.Lineage only (no hierarchy)enables tag propagation to downstream assets only.No propagationdisables any tag propagation.
- Hierarchy & lineageenables tag propagation to child and downstream assets.
- Hierarchy only (no lineage)enables tag propagation to child assets only.
- Lineage only (no hierarchy)enables tag propagation to downstream assets only.
- No propagationdisables any tag propagation.
This is particularly useful when you want to tag data for a business domain or project use. Atlan includes all assets under the level you tag in that business domain or project.


# To linked assetsâ

Atlan can propagate tags to alllinked assetsforterms. For example:
- Youtag a glossary termasPublic.
- Atlan tags all the linked assets for that term asPublic, too, if propagation is enabled.
- You can also configure the propagation of your tags:Hierarchy & lineageenables tag propagation to child and downstream assets.Hierarchy only (no lineage)enables tag propogation to child assets only.Lineage only (no hierarchy)enables tag propogation to downstream assets only.No propagationdisables any tag propagation.
- Hierarchy & lineageenables tag propagation to child and downstream assets.
- Hierarchy only (no lineage)enables tag propogation to child assets only.
- Lineage only (no hierarchy)enables tag propogation to downstream assets only.
- No propagationdisables any tag propagation.
This is particularly useful when you want to tag data en masse for use across all teams. If propagation is enabled, Atlan includes all linked assets for the tagged term.

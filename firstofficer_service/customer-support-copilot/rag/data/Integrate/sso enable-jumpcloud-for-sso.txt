# Enable  JumpCloud for SSO

You will need to be an admin user within Atlan to configure SSO. You will also need to work with your JumpCloud administrator to carry out the tasks below in JumpCloud.
SSO group mappings are triggered every time a user authenticates in Atlan. A user may need to log out and then log into Atlan again to view the changes. If a user is added to a new group or removed from an existing one in JumpCloud, the updates will also be reflected in Atlan. To ensure that the sync is successful, the groups that the user belongs to should be mapped in Atlan, and if a group name has changed in JumpCloud, you will need to update the group name in Atlan as well. For any questions about group mapping sync, head overhere.

By default, users can now log into Atlan with either JumpCloud SSO or a local Atlan account (via email). To only allow logins via SSO, enable theEnforce SSOoption in Atlan. Once SSO is enforced, we recommend asking your JumpCloud administrator to provision access to users through JumpCloud andnot directly from Atlan. When access has been provided, a user will be able to log into Atlan directly and their profile will be generated automatically.


# (Optional) Configure group mappingsâ

Before you can configure group mapping, you will first need tocreate groups in Atlanthat correspond to the groups you want to map from JumpCloud to Atlan. In addition, you must configure thememberOfattribute and group mapping to retain group membership in Atlan.
To automatically assign JumpCloud users to Atlan groups based on their JumpCloud groups, within Atlan:
- From the left menu on any screen, navigate toÂAdmin.
- Under theÂWorkspaceheading, clickÂSSO.
- Change to theGroups Mappingtab.
- To the right of each Atlan group listed:Under theSSO Groupscolumn, type the name of the corresponding group in JumpCloud to map to the Atlan group on that row   -  for example,Data Engineering,Business Analysts, and so on. You will need to provide each JumpCloud group with access to Atlan.Click theÂSavebutton on that row.
- Under theSSO Groupscolumn, type the name of the corresponding group in JumpCloud to map to the Atlan group on that row   -  for example,Data Engineering,Business Analysts, and so on. You will need to provide each JumpCloud group with access to Atlan.

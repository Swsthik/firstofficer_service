# Enable  Google for SSO

You will need to be an admin user within Atlan to configure SSO. You will also need to work with your Google domain administrator to carry out the tasks below in the Google Admin Center.
SSO group mappings are triggered every time a user authenticates in Atlan. A user may need to log out and then log into Atlan again to view the changes. If a user is added to a new group or removed from an existing one in Google, the updates will also be reflected in Atlan. To ensure that the sync is successful, the groups that the user belongs to should be mapped in Atlan, and if a group name has changed in Google, you will need to update the group name in Atlan as well. For any questions about group mapping sync, head overhere.

By default, users can now log into Atlan with either Google SSO or a local Atlan account (via email). To only allow logins via SSO, enable theEnforce SSOoption in Atlan. Once SSO is enforced, we recommend asking your Google domain administrator to provision access to users through the Google Admin Center andnot directly from Atlan. When access has been provided, a user will be able to log into Atlan directly and their profile will be generated automatically.

# Why did my users not receive an invite email from Atlan?

If you have sent an invite from Atlan but your user(s) did not receive it, Atlan recommends the following:
- Check if the email has been routed to the user's spam mailbox.
- Add users to the Atlan app in your SSO provider. WhenSSO is integrated, you do not need toinvite usersvia the Atlan UI (using their email). Instead, the first time a user logs into Atlan via SSO, their user profile will be automatically created.

# Authenticate SSO credentials to query data

AnyAtlan userwithdata access to the assetand SSO credentials for the connection.
Once your connection admins have configured SSO authentication, you can query data using your SSO credentials. Atlan currently supports the following connectors for SSO authentication:
- Amazon Redshift-  currently only Okta is supported as the identity provider.
- Google BigQuery-  Atlan uses Google OAuth 2.0, which handles integration with all identity providers. However, Atlan has only validated the integration with Okta.
- Snowflake-  Atlan usesSnowflake External OAuthfor SSO authentication, thus supporting allSnowflake-supported identity providers.
To query data using shared credentials instead, refer toProvide credentials to query data.
Connections that require you to provide SSO credentials have a small icon next to them. If the connection you want to query has no icon, you can query it with its default shared credentials. You only need to authenticate for connections with this icon.

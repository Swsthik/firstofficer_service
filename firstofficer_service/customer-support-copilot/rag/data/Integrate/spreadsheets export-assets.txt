# Export Assets

Before you can export assets to spreadsheets, you will first need your Atlan admin toenable asset export.
Atlan enables you to export all your assets or afiltered subset of assetsto spreadsheets. Atlan currently supports exporting assets to:
- Google Sheets
- Microsoft Excel online
Once yourAtlan adminhas integrated a supported tool, you will be able to export your assets and asset metadata to spreadsheets. Your existingpermissionsandaccess policiesin Atlan will determine whether you can export assets, but at a minimum you'll require read permission on the assets you want to export.
For example, you can:
- Export a list of assets that need enrichment and share the spreadsheet widely to crowdsource documentation.
- Export your business glossary and bring everyone up to speed on commonly used terminology across the organization.
To export impacted assets, seeHow to download and export lineage.
Atlan currently limits the total number of assets you can export to 150,000 rows. Reach out to your customer success manager if you'd like to increase the limit for your organization.


# Supported assets for exportâ

You can export assets from the following tabs:


# Assets tabâ

- All assets
- Filtered subset of assets
- Child assets such as columns or fields from theparent asset profile


# Glossary tabâ

- Glossary profile-  all categories and terms within a glossary
- Category profile-  all direct subcategories and terms within a category
- Term profile-linked assets for termsfrom theLinked Assetstab


# Reporting tabâ

- Assetsdashboard-total assets, archived assets, assets by certificates, SQL assets,assets without enrichment,assets with lineage, and assets with announcements
- Glossarydashboard-linked assets for terms
- Insightsdashboard-query assets with certificate
- Usage & Costdashboard-suggested assets for deprecation


# Enable asset exportâ

You will need to be anadmin userin Atlan to integrate a supported tool   -  Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel   -  and enable your users to export assets. For Atlan admins, you do not have to set the following permissions manually. You can simply sign in to your Google or Microsoft account while integrating the supported tool, which in turn will automatically set the permissions and grant appropriate access to your users.
The export icon or button will only be visible if your Atlan admin has integrated a supported tool. If you cannot see the export icon or button, reach out to your Atlan admin to integrate Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.
Atlan uses the following permissions to integrate supported tools:
- Google Sheets:https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file-  allows the app to see, edit, create, and delete only specific Google Drive files used with the Google Sheets app. This enables Atlan to create and update spreadsheets with exported assets. Refer toGoogle documentation.
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file-  allows the app to see, edit, create, and delete only specific Google Drive files used with the Google Sheets app. This enables Atlan to create and update spreadsheets with exported assets. Refer toGoogle documentation.
- Microsoft Excel:Files.ReadWrite-  allows the app to read, create, update, and delete the signed-in user's OneDrive files. This enables Atlan to create and update spreadsheets with exported assets. Note that access is restricted to the signed-in user's files   -  Atlan does not access any shared files. Refer toMicrosoft documentation.offline_access-  allows the app to access resources on behalf of the users, even when users are not currently using the app. Refer toMicrosoft documentation.User.Read-  allows users to sign in to the app, and allows the app to read the profile of signed-in users. This enables Atlan to authenticate the user. Atlan only supports authenticating with an organizational account. Refer toMicrosoft documentation.
- Files.ReadWrite-  allows the app to read, create, update, and delete the signed-in user's OneDrive files. This enables Atlan to create and update spreadsheets with exported assets. Note that access is restricted to the signed-in user's files   -  Atlan does not access any shared files. Refer toMicrosoft documentation.
- offline_access-  allows the app to access resources on behalf of the users, even when users are not currently using the app. Refer toMicrosoft documentation.
- User.Read-  allows users to sign in to the app, and allows the app to read the profile of signed-in users. This enables Atlan to authenticate the user. Atlan only supports authenticating with an organizational account. Refer toMicrosoft documentation.
For Microsoft users, if your global administrator has enabled theadmin consent workflow, you will be prompted to request admin approval while attempting to integrate Microsoft Excel. Reach out to your admin toapprove the admin consent requestfrom the Microsoft Entra admin center. Additionally, if there is anyexpiry dateset for such requests, ensure that the request is approved within that period of time, otherwise you will need to request approval again.
To integrate a supported tool for exporting assets:
- From the left menu of any screen, clickAdmin.
- Under theWorkspaceheading, clickIntegrations.
- To connect Atlan to a supported tool for exporting assets:In theGoogle Sheetstile, click theConnectbutton. A sign-in dialog will appear and you will be redirected to sign in with your Google account. From the corresponding screen, clickAllowto integrate Atlan with Google Sheets.In theMicrosoft Exceltitle, click theConnectbutton. A sign-in dialog will appear and you will be redirected to sign in with your Microsoft account to integrate Atlan with Microsoft Excel.

- In theMicrosoft Exceltitle, click theConnectbutton. A sign-in dialog will appear and you will be redirected to sign in with your Microsoft account to integrate Atlan with Microsoft Excel.
Your users can now export assets from Atlan! ð


# Export assetsâ

Once an Atlan admin has integrated a supported tool, anyadmin, member, or guest userin Atlan with read permission on assets can export assets to spreadsheets.
Atlan recommends that you avoid exporting assets during workflow runs. Exporting assets while you have workflows running in the background may lead to duplicate assets on the spreadsheet.
Atlan allows you to export your assets to spreadsheets and view asset metadata in bulk.
At a tenant level, Atlan supports running five exports concurrently for each supported tool. If both Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel have been integrated, a total of 10 concurrent exports is supported. At an individual user level, only one export is allowed for each supported tool at a time, the rest will be auto-queued for execution.
To export your assets:
- From the left menu of any screen in Atlan, clickAssets.
- To export assets, in theAssetspage, you can either:Next to the search bar, click the 3-dot icon and then clickExportto export all assets.Apply any filters, click the 3-dot icon, and then clickExportto export a list of filtered assets.

# Update metadata in spreadsheets and sync to Atlanâ

Once you've exported your assets, you can use the Atlan extension for spreadsheets to update metadata for exported assets and sync your updates to Atlan. Atlan currently supports updating metadata and syncing updates for Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel.


# Update metadataâ

Anynon-guest user with edit access to an asset's metadatacan update metadata for exported assets and sync changes to Atlan. This only includes admin and member users.
Atlan also recommends noting the following while updating metadata:
- If asset import from Atlan to a spreadsheet is in progress, avoid making any updates until the import is completed.
- You cannot make any changes to columns marked read-only or grayed out. Any changes to those columns will not be synced to Atlan and you will receive an error message.
- You can remove or change the order of assets in the spreadsheet, but you cannot add or replace it with an entirely new set of assets.
- You cannot add extra columns to the spreadsheet   -  sync to Atlan will fail.
- Avoid having any empty rows between assets.
- Although you can make changes in the spreadsheet while a sync is in progress, avoid starting a new sync until the current one has ended.
- You can easily collaborate with other users on the spreadsheet. However, sync to Atlan will only be recorded for the username that initiated the sync.
- Atlan uses hidden sheets to create a snapshot of the changes you've made. Refrain from making any changes in the hidden sheets.

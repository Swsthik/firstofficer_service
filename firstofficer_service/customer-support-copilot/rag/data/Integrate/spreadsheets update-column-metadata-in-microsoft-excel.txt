# Update column metadata in Microsoft Excel

Once you'veconnected Atlan with Microsoft Excel, you can import the column metadata for all your data assets in Atlan and make changes to them directly in Microsoft Excel.
Atlan currently supports importing and updating column metadata for the following asset types:
- Tables
- Views
- Materialized views
- Looker explores
- Microsoft Power BI tables
- Salesforce objects
- Tableau data sources
You will need to be logged into your Atlan instance before you can start importing column metadata for your Atlan assets in Microsoft Excel. If you do not have thepermissionto update asset metadata, your changes will neither be pushed to Atlan nor will a request be created for approval   -  even if you receive a success message in Microsoft Excel. Ensure that you have the requisite permissions to update an asset before pushing your changes. Your user permissions are used to determine the bulk updates you can make to ensure that there is no adverse impact on assets beyond your scope of access.

# Manage system announcements

You will need to be an admin user in Atlan to manage system announcements.
Have you ever wanted to notify everyone on the system of something? System announcements allow you to do just that. For example, you could welcome your users when you're first launching Atlan. Or you could use it to warn them about planned outages to large parts of your IT landscape.
System announcements appear on the homepage of all users, in an announcement box underRecent updates.
You can only create one system announcement per instance. To add more information to your system announcement, you can either edit the existing one to update it or delete the old one and create a new system announcement.

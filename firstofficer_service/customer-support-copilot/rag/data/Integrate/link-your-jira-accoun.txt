# Link your Jira account

To create and link Jira issues inside Atlan, you may first need to link your Jira account. This is done automatically for the admin user thatset up the Jira integration, but not for other users.
An Atlan admin must set up the tenant-level Jira integration in Atlan before any other user can perform a user-level integration. This is because the Atlan app installation requires inputs and approval from an administrator of your Jira workspace. Once the Jira integration has been completed, you can link your Jira account to Atlan without requiring any additional permissions from your Atlan or Jira admin.

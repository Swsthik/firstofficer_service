# Create announcements

Adding an announcement to your data asset helps you call attention to an important feature or notify others about a change coming down the pipeline. Since announcements in Atlan display the time stamp and author information, you can easily identify whether an announcement is still relevant and who to ask for questions.
What type of announcements would you want to share with your team? Here are a few examples:

# When does Atlan become a personal data processor or subprocessor?

Atlan personnel do not have access to any customer instance unless specifically provided by the customer. Accordingly, in the event that a customer instance contains personal data and Atlan personnel are provided access to that instance, Atlan may act as a personal data processor. In addition, depending on whether the customer is a data controller or processor, Atlan may act as a data processor or subprocessor, respectively.
For this purpose, where Atlan customers intend to crawl any personal data into the platform, Atlan enters into a data protection agreement with its customers, and as applicable: aStandard Contractual Clauses (SCC)under EU GDPR, anInternational data transfer agreement (IDTA)under UK GDPR, or aHIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA)when dealing with personal health information governed by HIPAA regulations.

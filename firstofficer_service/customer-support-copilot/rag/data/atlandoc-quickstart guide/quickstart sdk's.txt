# Software development kits (SDKs)

You can integrate with Atlan in several ways. We recommend using one of oursoftware development kits (SDKs), if possible, which:
- encode best practices,
- are built for performance,
- and add validations and simplifications not found in the raw REST APIs themselves.
Our SDKs are nothing more than client libraries that wrap our underlying REST APIs. They prevent you from needing to reinvent the wheel by wrapping the REST APIs yourself.

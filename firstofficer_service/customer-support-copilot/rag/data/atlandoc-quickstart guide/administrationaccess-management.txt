# Tenant access management

For any Atlan tenant, there are three types of access required for troubleshooting an issue:
- access to cloud resources
- access to vCluster or dedicated Kubernetes (K8s) cluster
- access to product


# Access to cloud resourcesâ

- Identify need for access   -  access to the cloud resources of a tenant is generally required to debug an issue related to infrastructure components. For any tenant, cloud resources include cloud storage, secrets, Kubernetes cluster, network rules, and more.
- Request access   -  if an Atlan engineer troubleshooting an issue requires access to any cloud resource, the engineer must raise a formal request using Atlan's service request ticketing system with the appropriate justification.
- Approval process   -  the request will be reviewed and require approval from a relevant authority, likely a manager or another team member responsible for access control.
- Access granting   -  once approved, the IT team at Atlan will grant access to the resource for a specified period of time.
- Access revocation   -  after the specified period of time is over or troubleshooting has been completed, the IT team will revoke access to avoid any unauthorized or prolonged access.


# Access to clusterâ

- Identify need for access   -  access to vCluster or dedicated Kubernetes (K8s) cluster is required to troubleshoot an issue related to Kubernetes resources.

- Request access   -  if an Atlan engineer troubleshooting an issue requires access to a vcluster or dedicated cluster, the engineer must raise a formal request using Atlan's service request ticketing system with the appropriate justification.
- Approval process   -  the request will be reviewed and require approval from a relevant authority, likely a manager or another team member responsible for access control.
- Access granting   -  once approved, the IT team at Atlan will grant access to the resource for a specified period of time.

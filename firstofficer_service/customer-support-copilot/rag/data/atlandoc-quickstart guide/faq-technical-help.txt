# Support and Technical Help

Complete guide to getting support, understanding API limits, and accessing technical assistance for Atlan.


# What's the availability of support?â

Atlan support provides full coverage during business hours across most time zones. See alsoCustomer support.


# Is there a limit on the number of API requests that can be performed?â

Most automated operations that need to process many records follow one of these patterns:
- Search-based extract
- End-to-end bulk update
These patterns minimise the total number of API calls because each request extracts or updates many records, so you're unlikely to hit rate limits.
If you make raw API requests directly, different endpoints have different limits. As a rule of thumb, assumeabout 1,000 requests per minute per host(your Atlan domain). Whenever possible, adopt the patterns mentioned earlier to avoid these limits.


# What's the recommended path for pagination of asset searches with scroll API?â

Refer toPaging search resultsin the developer documentation for the recommended scroll API implementation.


# Is Atlan compatible with data quality tools?â

Yes. Atlan integrates with several data-quality and observability platforms:
- Native integrations such asMonte Carlo,Soda, andAnomalo
- Ability to surface quality scores and alerts in asset profiles
- REST APIs to ingest additional quality metadata from any tool you choose

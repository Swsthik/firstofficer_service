# Generate HAR files and console logs

Atlan is built onREST APIs, so you can see the requests being sent by the UI to the API gateway through your browser's developer console.
To help Atlan troubleshoot issues, you may be asked to create and send a HAR file and browser console logs:
- Console or network logsfrequently provide critical error details that are required to determine the underlying cause of the issue or bug that you are experiencing.
- HAR filesinclude all the network traffic from when you started recording, including sensitive information like passwords and private keys. To avoid including such information in a HAR file, Atlan recommends using a text editor to manually edit the file and remove any sensitive content before sending it to Atlan support.

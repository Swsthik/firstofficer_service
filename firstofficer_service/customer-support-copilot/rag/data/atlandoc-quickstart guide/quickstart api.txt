# Atlan's open API

Like you, we hate being locked into closed, black-box platforms. That's why we built Atlan's core platform on leading open-source projects and made every action API-driven.
Everything visible on Atlan is powered by APIs.
Our mission is to help youactivate your metadata, to help your team do its best work. So we are gradually opening up these APIs for everyone.

For any critical issues, the Incident Response Team at Atlan will follow a structured process designed to investigate, contain, and remediate the threat as well as recover systems and services. The process includes:
- Event reported   -  initial notification of the incident.
- Triage and analysisÂ   -  assessment of the incident's severity and potential impact.
- InvestigationÂ   -  detailed examination to understand the cause and scope.
- Containment and neutralizationÂ   -  actions to limit the impact and prevent further exploitation.
- Recovery and vulnerability remediationÂ   -  restoration of systems and addressing vulnerabilities.
- Hardening and detection improvementsÂ   -  enhancing security measures and detection capabilities to prevent future incidents.
Key details about this process are as follows:
- Incident managerÂ   -  oversees incident response efforts.
- War roomÂ   -  a central location, either physical or virtual (for example, Slack), dedicated to managing the incident.
- Recurring meetingsÂ   -  regular meetings to review the incident status until resolution.
- NotificationÂ   -  legal and executive staff will be informed as required.

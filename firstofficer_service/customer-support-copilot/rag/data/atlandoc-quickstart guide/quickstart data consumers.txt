# Insightsâ

Atlan was built by data teams for data teams, so we know that querying your data is crucial to answering important business questions.
SQL is the most common way that data teams query their data, so we wanted to make it easy for Atlan users to seamlessly query and share SQL work with their team.
Atlan'sInsightsworkspace allows teams to find the data they need, query it, and save and manage all SQL queries in one place. You can write SQL queries from scratch or use the Visual Query Builder to write SQL scripts quicker.
The Visual Query Builder is a great way to start building complex queries without fluency in SQL. Think of it as "fill in the blank" but for queries!
Some of our favorite features about Insights:
- Customize the SQL editor's look and feel through preferences
- Examine a data asset's lineage alongside your SQL editor, so you can effortlessly understand your data asset in relation to other assets
- Save, organize, and share your SQL queries
